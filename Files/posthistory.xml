Link the name to the user's profile so we can see their activity.&#xD;&#xA;* The nominee should indicate their acceptance by commenting on (or indeed editing) the answer.&#xD;&#xA;* The top voted nominations can go forward to the vote.&#xD;&#xA;* The voting will be done on a separate question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The candidate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Must be a currently registered user in good standing&#xD;&#xA;* Must have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.&#xD;&#xA;* Should exhibit patience and fairness at all times in their questions, answers, and comments.&#xD;&#xA;* Should lead by example, showing respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.&#xD;&#xA;* They should want the responsibility.

If I forgot someone, please, feel free to edit my post or remind me in a comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Remote Sensing Users&#xD;&#xA; - GeoDjango and Python GIS Libraries users (geoscript, and others)&#xD;&#xA; - Spatial Databases guys, specially: Oracle Spatial/GeoRaster, MySQL Spatial, Spatial Lite, SQL Server 2008&#xD;&#xA; - .NET Library fellows. NTS and other great libraries developed for .NET&#xD;&#xA; - All OsGeo developers users (I know a lot of them, and some are already here - thanks for the support)&#xD;&#xA; - Cartographers&#xD;&#xA; - Topography and GNSS people.&#xD;&#xA; - Theorethical GIS researchers/students. There a small number of them here. Who else can we include? Remember that GIS is a tool that is applied to a diverse number of disciplines, like biology, geography, geology, marketing, military sciences, transit and transportation and many, many others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short: we need ideas to call all this user bases to become part of our community. How can we attract them? Give ideas, take initiatives, let's make this community big and top notch place for GIS/Geotechnologies experts!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks for the attention :P" />

As George notes, most of the questions are programming or user-interface related.  I'm primarily a statistical analyst, so the extensive technical questions on the main page just make my eyes glaze over.  They're either way too technical for me to even begin to answer, or way too trivial, or yet another iteration of &quot;What's an alternative to [ESRI tool]?&quot;  Obviously these questions are not inherently bad, but they just don't interest me and are generally irrelevant to my work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some ways, I suspect that this is because of the amorphous nature of GIS: it's very programming-intensive, its GUI programs are huge and packed with features, and there are strong links to several disciplines, from geography to statistics.  Statistics has the same shape, albeit to a lesser degree; however, stats.stackexchange.com is relatively strict about what kinds of questions are allowed.  We don't allow most questions about &quot;How do I do [procedure x] in [software y]?&quot;, and questions that are mostly about programming are encouraged to be diverted to StackOverflow.  Many of the questions that remain are focused on concepts and theory, and are often quite challenging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not arguing that that model would work here - distinguishing between questions that should stay here, go to StackOverflow, or perhaps to another StackExchange site (like Stats) is a **hard** problem.  But if we don't have questions about remote sensing or spatial stats or whatever else here, people who are interested primarily in those things won't show up.  Worse, I think, if we don't *routinely* have questions about those kinds of things here - if they aren't showing up on the main page regularly - people who are interested primarily in those things won't stick around to build up the community(1).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the key to building the site is to work on both our push (putting the address in signatures and mentioning it on other forums and at professional gatherings, actively poaching questioners from StackOverflow, etc.) and our pull (interesting questions with awesome answers on a variety of topics).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those of us who are interested in the non-technical stuff definitely need to ask more questions (sorry!), and those of you who have the amazing technical skills could perhaps ask questions about your peripheral interests.  Even asking questions to which we already have answers will help, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that while we're in the bootstrapping mode (or anytime, really).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And hey... when those R questions start showing up, I'll be on them.  I just haven't seen any yet :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(1) I think StackOverflow avoids this problem because of the sheer volume of questions - even a tiny language like R still gets several questions per day, so I can reasonably expect to find something interesting there any time I visit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/1441/net-components-triggering-itools-on-arcengine-objects" />

For comparison [here][3] is the page for the Stats forum (I did not know of this until someone recently posted it on the Stats meta forum). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I figured some of these metrics weren't brought up in the former questions regarding GIS getting the axe or [growing the community][4], so this question is worth revisiting in a new (and hopefully well viewed) thread.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So we are doing well or excellent in percentage answers accepted, number of answers per question, and okay in the number of views per day. Where the metrics say we are lacking is the number of questions and the number of high rep users (high rep defined as simply 200 reputation, a seemingly quite low standard). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a researcher I feel exactly the same as Matt Parker listed in this [answer][5], and we need to ask more questions related to such topics (myself included) to both help growth and develop a core body of experts. I think one thing that we are lacking, both in analysis related and programming related questions, are simple questions that are oft encountered. Even if the user knows the answer such questions will be good to drive up traffic and allow other users to gain more reputation. They will also create templates of simple &quot;FAQs&quot; to point users to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know the dichotomous reading of the metrics are silly, and these statistics are as comforting as they are disconcerting, but if the Stackexchange sites care about them I feel we should care about them as well. It seems an easy solution to increase the number of questions asked, even if the expert knowledge to answer those questions is quite low to simply help the site grow at this point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.gis.stackexchange.com/questions/147/how-can-we-keep-gis-se-from-getting-the-axe&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1425/geographic-information-systems&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/33/statistical-analysis&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.gis.stackexchange.com/questions/121/helping-gis-se-communty-growth&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://meta.gis.stackexchange.com/questions/121/helping-gis-se-communty-growth/125#125" />

SO, due to its size, can get away with that, but this one can't.  Where are the questions about principles of GIS?  About GIS science?  About programming principles, GIS database techniques and strategies, cartographic techniques, appropriate use of projections and coordinate systems, and on and on?

I personally resisted for a few days because in the wake of the recent [removal of CW check box][3] on new questions I have some confusion as to what should or shouldn't be community wiki, and waited to see what the other moderators would do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Today in [&quot;Should poll questions be Community Wiki?&quot;][4] I found a sentiment which crystalized things for me and I acted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In principle, there's no reason why&#xD;&#xA;&gt; they should be [community wiki]. Either the question is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; off-topic and should be removed, or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; it's on-topic and its wiki state&#xD;&#xA;&gt; should be at the discretion of its&#xD;&#xA;&gt; author.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In practice, there's a very good&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reason why they should be: polls work&#xD;&#xA;&gt; very, very poorly when answers cannot&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be voted on without giving or taking&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rep from the voters and votees.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Furthermore, when posting a popular&#xD;&#xA;&gt; answer stands to garner rep for its&#xD;&#xA;&gt; author, there's more temptation to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; post a duplicate rather than up-voting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an existing answer. And making a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; question CW is the only way to force&#xD;&#xA;&gt; all answers to be CW as well.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; So long as the system continues to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; work this way, poll questions should&#xD;&#xA;&gt; always be CW for practical reasons.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Admins should force this upon them if&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the original author neglects to do&#xD;&#xA;&gt; so...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Belatedly I realised with this act I effectively pushed *Poll questions should be Community Wiki* as a general GIS.se policy without discussion, and I only momentarily hold a Moderator's torch.

I'm Jin, and I'll be working on the final designs for the Stack Exchange sites. Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflect its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family. As part of the [7 Essential Meta Questions of Every Beta][1], we're supposed to be working on the site design and logo. Below are some of my early design ideas for the GIS site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a period of sharing of ideas and information between artists and technologists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That quote is from [one][2] of the many articles I found while researching for the GIS site design. I've been reading related materials on the web, as well as the type of questions asked on GIS.SE. I find the field of GIS very fascinating, since it combines long established cartography and modern day technology. I believe an appropriate theme should reflect some hints of vintage cartography AND the modern tech elements. Additional design goals are to make the site easy to read and welcoming to new users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To convey the vintage theme, I created a compass icon for the logo and used a faint world map as the back drop of the site. I felt the compass is appropriate since it has timeless visual association with maps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The type of questions asked on the site are mostly technology related. Modern day GIS are used in apps, so for the content area UI, I think a sleek &quot;web app&quot; look works well. It provides a nice balance to the retro logo and site background.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The overall color scheme is earth toned pastel colors. I think the combination gives a warm and soothing feel. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without further adieu, here are the design mockups. Although they may not have all the site elements, they should give you an idea of the overall look and feel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*(click to see the full resolution versions)*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/hy8G5.jpg&quot;&gt;![alt text][4]&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/gyfzb.jpg&quot;&gt;![alt text][5]&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please let me know what you think. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap413/p413.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Museo-Slab&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.imgur.com/hy8G5.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.imgur.com/gyfzb.jpg" />

Its great that Stackexchange is willing to invest expert time in making these sites visually representative of their specific audiences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fonts, use of pushpins, and the compass are all great: they work well and add a nice flavor to the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few minor ideas: I like the look of the #tab bar on sites such as Ask Ubuntu, I can see the argument to keep them as a visually identifiable block, but think either a smoother style or removal of the background and top/bottom borders.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Playing around with the iconography used for the up/down arrows is interesting as Andy mentioned: you could keep it in 3D by taking a [3d rendered compass rose][1], and reusing only the north and south pieces of it. Similarly, you could use the north/south of a [compass pointer][2] to create a similar effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even a more minor detail might be modifying the star, one idea I like is using it to throw in a shout-out to projection, which plays an important role in geographic problems. The American Association of Geographers logo [provides an example][3] of this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, another 'nice touch' that may or may not be worth the effort is using one of the [color brewer schemes][4] for some of the visual elements: they provide a connection back to maps, but also a nice way of visually distinguishing elements that are 'positive' and 'negative' within the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can provide more context if needed, and help generating some [star projections][5] if you do think the idea's worth taking up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.fotosearch.com/bthumb/CSP/CSP118/k1184096.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/052/Purple/40/c8/66/mzl.pathcmmi.480x480-75.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_pgrjV7xqqVY/Sbj7eO8iWvI/AAAAAAAAAWg/MPX_zBU7Uq0/s400/idx_logo.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://colorbrewer2.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjInt/ProjStar/projStar.html" />

If you move on without upvoting, that's +0 points.  If you downvote, it's -2 points.  Thus, *not voting is 10/12 = 83% as bad as downvoting!*  A similar calculation applies to votes on questions.  As a rule of thumb, if you're an active respondent, you should find it easy to put as many points into play as you receive: your votes:points ratio should be at least 0.1, more or less.  If you're an active reader but don't respond much, you should have no trouble multiplying this minimum ratio several fold.  Go inspect the users page to see who's meeting these criteria.  Not many.

Maybe there is a flyer for Stack Overflow that we could adapt?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.orurisa.org/GIS_In_Action%20%22GIS%20In%20Action" />

Should the visualisation tag be referred to only questions that ask for applied knowledge about visualization (i.e. how should I display this) as opposed to what is this called or how to do x with y (which may involve visualizing info but not necessarily deal with why you should visualize info in a particular way)?

Is there a rule, unwritten or otherwise, that requests and requires that any question posted here not be found on any other forum regardless of how closely tied it is with Stack Exchange? I have seen posts and comments that finger-wag at a user for having a question on both GIS.se and the ESRI support forums. In my mind, these two entities are far enough apart that it is right and proper to expect useful (and perhaps different) information to arise from asking in both locations.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On that note, is it also considered bad form to simply link to another answer on a non Stack Exchange site?

The aim is to come up with tag or some other method of filtering between them, a means to unearth the gems (which never arise on their own; crystals precipitate out of a surrounding solution) to which the &quot;fluffy&quot; questions owe their existence. The stack exchange voting system has done wonders for separating wheat from chaff, seed from stalk, but we can go farther, perhaps.

That is not the main point I'm trying to make though. When their is a tag making such a distinction it perpetuates a perceieved distinction between the two types of questions. This perception is what I believe could lead to the bifurcation of the community, and segregate those contributing mainly to one side or the other. IMO it is segregating programming from GIScience when they shouldn't be segregated at all. I believe you have said in other places essentially that SO can get away with that due to its size, I don't think it is conducive to growth in this community though. Regardless if the scope of the tag is refined, I don't think this is a good idea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://gis.stackexchange.com/q/9331/751&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://gis.stackexchange.com/q/9310/751" />

Given the numbers voting, the highest rates--44%, 40%, and 38% (ours)--are statistically indistinguishable and hugely greater than the other voting rates quoted here.  We also have a high rate of voting among those who visited the election page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There won't ever be a definitive interpretation of any election statistics, but my take was that members of this GIS community are fairly well engaged, we had a good number of moderator candidates offering a spectrum of experiences and views, we have some important but not critical issues to deal with, and we're collaborating in a friendly environment that was established and ably cultivated by our *pro tem* mods, especially @Matt Wilkie and @SCW.  I believe all these factors contributed to our high voting turnout.  It is humbling to be among those chosen.  I hope that all of you will be quick to let us (the new mods) know how we can keep the site working well for you and how to improve it, but please let's not create issues where none exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://se.awio.com/election.html" />

When an upvoted or accepted reply contains code, we can (retroactively if necessary) apply the appropriate &quot;code&quot; tag.  This would make the solution accessible through searches.  This would be more efficient and effective than trying to create a separate place for code only.  Moreover, the search would disclose the code within the context of a question, other answers, and the comment streams.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All you really need to think through is whether a single generic `code` tag would work or whether you want language- or platform-specific tags like `code-sql`, `code-python`, etc.  I would recommend the first because you can refine your searches with keywords, like &quot;sql&quot; or &quot;python&quot;, to ferret out the language in which you're interested (if that matters so much).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that a `code` tag [exists][1] but does not yet have a well-defined meaning: apart from this thread, only two others have been tagged with it.  So it's there for us to use.  Mods can support such use by means of a FAQ entry and a wiki entry for the tag, but its maintenance (i.e., applying the tag appropriately) would have to be done by everyone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code" />
